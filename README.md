We understand it can be difficult to express coding experience during an interview so as part of the selection process we have built a simple Laravel based interface to judge how you approach programming tasks.

In this repository you will find a brand new Laravel install (as of 15th Feb 2021), this contains some blade files styled with Tailwind CSS.

We require you to take the static blade website files and convert to a dynamic website. We would like the following sections to be dynamically driven by a database/ data storage of your choice:

- __Latest News__ section to be pulled from a database.
- __User Login__ section to allow a user to login, this can use any method of your choice.
- __Secure Page__ content only accessible once logged in.

This is not designed to trick you, it is simply an excercise to determine how you approach Laravel and structure your code.

## Install

- `git clone git@github.com:cuhu/laravel-skills-test.git`
- `composer install`
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` 

If changing any front-end:

- `npm install`
- `npm run watch`


## Deliverables

Please send basic instructions, databases, GIT links, or ZIP files, including any `.env` variables that we might need to get your example up and running to __dan@cuhu.co.uk__.

Thanks!
